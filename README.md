# thymiosuite-setup

The installation process  (https://www.thymio.org/linux-installation) for the **ThymioSuite** on Linux is far too complicated for an average user. As a remedy comes this Debian package, which should work on any deb based distribution.

Just install this package and your ready to programm the Thymio robot. (The prozess might take a very long time. Be patient ...)  

Note: It is not a real Debian package, it's just an installer alike checkinstall.
